# Light-Cycle

This is the core working repo for the Makers Academy final engineering project by Robin Tyler, George Hancock, Henry Boylan, Mykhailo Skliarenko in January 2023

**Our mission was to learn how to create a simple 2D game, take it online multiplayer, and be able to play it cross-platform. We wanted to use frameworks we had not encountered before to further our learning.**

 ## A game based on TRON and snake
 Playable solo, local multiplayer, or online multiplayer.
 Game written in React (web), React Native (Mobile app), and Node.js (Server). Multiplayer connections with WebSocket, styling with CSS

## Design Mockup

## Installation instructions
Clone this repo and navigate into it.
```
npm install
npm start (*check this script*)
navigate to browser at localhost:3000
```
To navigate to the mobile app version, you will need to download and use the expo app- for instructions on how to do this and link to computer please read the getting started docs for React Native. 

## Playing instructions
Use mouse to select option you want; 2 player local play or single player will work fine, but online multiplayer won't work at the moment, for 2 reasons; it requires a second player on a separate computer to select the mode, and the remote server that runs the game is not kept in an active state.
Player one uses keys w,a,s,d to move their cycle. Player two uses keys i,j,k,l. The rest of the game should be self explanatory
